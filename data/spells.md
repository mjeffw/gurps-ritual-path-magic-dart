# Grimoire

## Air Jet
 *  _Spell Effects:_ Greater Control Matter.
 *  _Inherent Modifiers:_ Damage, External Crushing (Double Knockback; Jet; No Wounding).
 *  _Greater Effects:_ 1 (×3).

This spell conjures a jet (p. B106) of air extending from the caster’s hand or an object that he is holding. The target takes 3d crushing damage; this does no actual damage, but it does inflict blunt trauma and is doubled for knockback purposes.

 *  _Typical Casting:_ Greater Control Matter (5) + Damage, External Crushing 3d (Double Knockback, +20%; Jet, +0%; No Wounding, -50%) (1). _18 energy (6×3)._

## Amplify Injury
 *  _Spell Effects:_ Greater Destroy Body.
 *  _Inherent Modifiers:_ Altered Trait, Vulnerability to Physical Attacks.
 *  _Greater Effects:_ 1 (×3).

This spell causes the target to suffer double normal injury from physical attacks (those that use some sort of material substance to cause harm) for the next 10 minutes. This does not increase the damage from energy, mental attacks, etc. The target must be within 10 yards.

 *  _Typical Casting:_ Greater Destroy Body (5) + Altered Trait, Vulnerability to Physical Attacks ×2 (8) + Duration, 10 minutes (1) + Range, 10 yards (4) + Subject Weight, 300 lbs. (3). _63 energy (21×3)._

## Babble On
 *  _Spell Effects:_ Lesser Sense Mind + Lesser Strengthen Mind.
 *  _Inherent Modifiers:_ Area of Effect, Altered Trait, Babel-Tongue.
 *  _Greater Effects:_ 0 (×1).

This spell grants the subjects (at least two) the ability to converse with one another in a mystically made-up language called “Babel-Tongue” – so called after the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel. All subjects who are to be affected must be within 3 yards of the caster. The “Babel-Tongue” language is created anew for each casting; it cannot be learned normally. Only those under the effects of this spell (or who have some other supernatural means to speak unknown and alien languages) can comprehend it.

 *  _Typical Casting:_ Lesser Sense Mind (2) + Lesser Strengthen Mind (3) + Altered Trait, Babel-Tongue (Native/None) (3) + Area of Effect, 3 yards (2) + Duration, 1 hour (3). _13 energy (13×1)._

## Bag of Bones
 *  _Spell Effects:_ Greater Control Undead + Lesser Create Undead.
 *  _Inherent Modifiers:_ None.
 *  _Greater Effects:_ 1 (×3).

This spell is typically cast as a charm, which is then attached to a skeleton – normally a human one, though any skeleton weighing up to 100 lbs. will suffice. Once broken, the charm imbues dark magic into the bones, making them into an animated skeleton that follows the directions of the caster. After a day, the magic fades and the undead monster collapses into a heap. Statistics for animated skeletons can be found in several books, including on p. 152 of _**GURPS Magic**_; if you lack them, use ST 9, DX 12, IQ 8, HT 10, with DR 2, no skills, and other traits appropriate to an animated skeleton.

 *  _Typical Casting:_ Greater Control Undead (5) + Lesser Create Undead (6) + Lesser Control Magic (5) + Duration, 1 day (7) + Subject Weight, 100 lbs. (2). _75 energy (25×3)._
